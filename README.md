# Horiseon

## Description

The motivation behind this project is web accesibility. This is something that many businesses have taken up because it allows people with disabilites to access the wepbage given that it includes special assistive features.  This was done by refactoring the already exisiting code so that all the links work, the semantic HTML follows a logical structure, and the CSS selectors are consolidated. By doing what was just listed, the problem of litigation was solved because people with disablities can now access the website. Now the people with disabilites can access the website, the website is positioned higher in the search engine. This project taught me the importance of making a website accessible by making sure the code is not sloppy and includes semantic HTML.
